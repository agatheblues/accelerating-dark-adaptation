# Accelerating Dark Adaptation

This is the source code of [Accelerating Dark Adaptation](http://acceleratingdarkadaptation.com/), built with Mapbox GL JS, JQuery and Three.js. Accelerating Dark Adaptation is the graduation project of Manon Féval at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague ([KABK](https://www.kabk.nl/agenda/graduation-festival-2019)).

## About

Accelerating Dark Adaptation is a website in which the viewer can experience the city of Amsterdam at night through an infrared lens, navigating data points in which the light intensity and night quality have been measured. The viewer can visit these sites while listening to a collection of perspectives on darkness.

The aim is to bring a more positive image of darkness into our urban space as well as a better understanding of the negative effects of artificial lights, in order to preserve and protect our night skies not only out there, but also in here.

## Disclaimer

This was developed and created on my free time. As much as I tried to make it a finite product, browser compatible, device agnostic, there are surely some bugs lying around. If you feel like reporting or fixing it, PRs are open! 

## Known issues

This project relies heavily on the ability to autoplay videos and sound. It was tested on a few mobile devices, and it works thanks to a lil' hack, which might become obsolete in the years to come. 

Adblockers are also known to cause trouble with the videos.

## Credits

Thanks to Manon Féval for trusting me and giving me the opportunity to develop this project. Thanks to [PierreGUI](https://github.com/PierreGUI) for his help and support :heart:!
